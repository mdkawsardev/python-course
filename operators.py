# In this chapter we will discuss about python operators
# Assignment operators
# Assigning values in a variable
a = 23
b = 23
c = 20
b += a # b = b + a this is the defination
b -= a # b = b - a this is the definition
b *= a # b = b * a this is the defination
b /= a # b = b / a this is the defination
b %= a # b = b % a this is the defination
c *= 2
print(b)
print(c)

# Arithmetic operators
x = 20 + 2
y = 20 - 2
z = 20 * 20
xx = 20 / 20
yy = 20 % 20
print(x)

# Comparison operators
aa = 5 > 3
bb = 2 < 4
cc = 5 >= 5
dd = 5 <= 5
ee = 5 == 5
ff = 5 != 5
j = True
print(type(j)) # to check dataType
